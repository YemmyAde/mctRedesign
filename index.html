             I am a student of Jigawa State College of Education. I
            came across Wootlab Foundation on social media. I have learned so
            many things such as the use of Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Office,
            Canva, Corel Draw, Photoshop, and more knowledge about Digital
            Marketing. I had little knowledge before but now with Wootlab
            Foundation, I have become an intermediate marketer. I can stand on
            my own without relying on Government jobs. I really thank Wootlab
            Foundation for the guidance to make me self-dependent.

           I am an indigene of Kaduna state. I came across WOOTLAB

          ongoing free training for Graphics design that's about to start. I
          signed in and luckily I got accepted. After starting the course for
          some days, I realised that I am in the right place as a designer, in a
          short while I learned how to use Corel draw and canva app to create
          unique designs such as flyers, logos, business cards, certificate etc
          which has really helped in moving my career forward. A big

             Coming across WOOTLAB LEAD Initiatives where they offer

            felt so excited because these are the top-notch digital skills
            needed to triumph in this 21st century. Digital skills are highly
            valued and in the future, digital skills will be vital. As a student
            of Graphic Design, I have learnt Computer Graphic Design with Canva.
            This course improves my skills using photo editing and painting
            programs as well as my basic computer and technical skills. My
            sincerest appreciation to WOOTLAB FOUNDATION(LEADS Initiative) for
            bringing such an intensive opportunity to us at a NO Cost fee in
            order to reduce the unemployment rate in our country as well as
